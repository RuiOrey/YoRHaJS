Hey!!!

So, here is the first SAFER model out there.
Sadly, the only way to SUCCESSFULLY convert a model with colour was to export it to OBJ and such. So, this model is polygon'd and isn't smooth. I'll update it later, so don't worry about that problem.

Anyway,

Here go the Credits:

SQUARESOFT/Enix for original model. [YOU MUST DO THIS!!!]
Credit Me, SephirothReturns109 for conversion and rigging.
This will be edited so no need for self editing. I promise!!!
NO uusage for innapropriate usings or animations.
Be respect for Character, as it was meant to be used for fun and enjoyment in a noninnaporpriate way,. (SEE HOW IT'S USED IN THE GAME TO KNOW!!! YOUTUBE HAS MANY VIDEOS!!! CHECK THEM OUT!!!)

Then,

Just enjoy him!!!!
